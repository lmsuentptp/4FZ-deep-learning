# Deep Learning & ESG Research Projects

This repository contains research notebooks developed as part of my work at Keio University's Fukuhara Research Seminar, focusing on the intersection of deep learning, financial econometrics, and sustainability.

## ðŸ“˜ Projects Overview

- **SBT HumanCapital Simulation**  
  Agent-based simulation modeling tokenized human capital funding using Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) for education finance and labor market alignment.

- **Carbon Credits Market (Week 5â€“6)**  
  Exploratory analysis and deep learning models on carbon credit pricing mechanisms and sustainability-linked assets.

- **ESG Portfolio Optimization**  
  ESG signal extraction using NLP (BERT) on annual reports, with portfolio construction and performance evaluation.

- **Weekly Notebooks (Weeks 1â€“4)**  
  Iterative development of deep learning techniques applied to ESG metrics, financial data, and portfolio analysis.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries
- Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, BERT
- NetLogo (for agent-based simulation, linked to SBT models)
- ESG and sustainability datasets

# Deep Learning & ESG Research Projects

This repository contains research notebooks developed as part of my work at Keio University's Fukuhara Research Seminar, focusing on the intersection of deep learning, financial econometrics, and sustainability.

## 📘 Projects Overview

- **Weekly Notebooks**  
  Iterative development of deep learning techniques applied to ESG metrics, financial data, and portfolio analysis.
  
- **Carbon Credits Market**  
  Exploratory analysis and deep learning models on carbon credit pricing mechanisms and sustainability-linked assets.
  
- **SBT HumanCapital Simulation**  
  Agent-based simulation modeling tokenized human capital funding using Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) for education finance and labor market alignment.

- **ESG Portfolio Optimization**  
  ESG signal extraction using NLP (BERT) on annual reports, with portfolio construction and performance evaluation.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, BERT
- NetLogo (for agent-based simulation, linked to SBT models)
- ESG and sustainability datasets
